# Towards catalytic implementations of autocatalytic reactions 
The repository contains MATLAB scripts for simulating catalytic reaction systems that are reparameteriztions of autocatalytic reactions. A further implementaion of systems such as: (a) Consensus network, (b) Predator-prey oscillator is also included using the strand displacing polymerase architecture. These simulation scripts are a part of the paper "Towards catalytic implementations of arbitrary autocatalytic reactions" submitted as a full-paper to DNA26 track A conference in Oxford, UK (2020).
